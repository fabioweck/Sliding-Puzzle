# Sliding-Puzzle
A classic game built with .NET/Windows Forms

I built this game under requirements of my Software Development Diploma course from Bow Valley college.
This project is based on the game Sliding Puzzle, which consists of a board with tiles (numbers) out of order.
The player must put all tiles in ascending order and leaving the last position on the last row empty.
Anytime the player moves a tile, the moves counter increase by one. 
If the player manages to order all tiles, a pop-up display shows the number of moves the player took
and asks if he or she wants to play again.
On game load, a pop-up screen is displayed to the user offering 3 levels: easy, medium and hard.
These levels represent a board of 4 x 4, 5 x 5, and 6 x 6 respectively.
There are two buttons on the bottom - one is intended to shuffle all tiles again and restart the game, the other button
sorts the tiles and shows the solution to the user, again, resetting the game.
In the strip menu the user can change the level if desired. Anytime the level is changed, the game resets the number of moves.
