# Sliding-Puzzle
A classic game built with .NET/Windows Forms

I built this game under requirements of my Software Development Diploma course from Bow Valley college.
This project is based on the game Sliding Puzzle, which consists of a board with tiles (numbers) out of order.
The player must put all tiles in ascending order and leaving the last position on the last row empty.
Anytime the player moves a tile, the moves counter increase by one. 
If the player manages to order all tiles, a pop-up display shows the number of moves the player took
and asks if he or she wants to play again.
There are two buttons on the bottom - one is intended to shuffle all tiles again and restart the game, the other button
sorts the tiles and shows the solution to the user, again, resetting the game.
